## Today

* Review of linear regression.

## Course material

All lecture notes are in RMarkdown (`qmd`). It is a good idea to learn by running through the code examples. You can do this in several ways. 

### Run locally on your own computer

1. Install the most recent versions of R and RStudio. 

2. Git clone the course material in RStudio: `File` -> `New Project...` -> `Version Control` -> `Git`. Enter `https://github.com/ucla-biostat-200c/2024spring.git` in the `Repository URL` and click `Create Project`. 

3. Course material is updated frequently. Remember to `git pull` to obtain the most recent material at beginning of each session.
