## Today
* I apologize, I have to attend an important meeting in the 2nd hour [which I have been trying to schedule it from the last summer]. I will teach the 1st hour and will try to make up for the lost time during Thu lecture and future office hours if needed.

* Binary Response (ELMR Chapter 2).

* Residual analysis.
